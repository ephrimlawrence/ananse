# Ananse USSD Framework

Ananse is a full-stack framework for developing USSD applications in NodeJs. Ananse comes with batteries included, suitable for USSD projects of any size.

## Features

- Intuitive menu routing
- Supports any USSD gateway (Wigal, Hubtel, AfricasTalking, etc)
- Out-of-the-box session state management
- Session storage
- Input validation
- Pagination
- Command line simulator
- End-to-end testing with [Japa](https://japa.dev)

## Motivation

Due to the nature of USSD menu flows, using traditional frameworks like ExpressJS is difficult, even more so when debugging complex menu flows. This project aims to provide a framework that maximizes developers' productivity in building USSD applications.

## Installation

Use your favourite NodeJS package manager to install [ananse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ananse).

```bash npm2yarn
npm install ananse
```
