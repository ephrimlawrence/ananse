# Configuration

Before starting the project, there are a few things that need to be configured, such as session storage backend, USSD gateway, and pagination.

## Session storage

Ananse supports several backends for storing user sessions - in memory, Redis, MySQL and Postgres. In-memory session storage is used by default but can be changed to another backend. The session storage can be configured using the `session` option in the `configure` method.


```typescript
import { Ananse } from "ananse";

const ananse = new Ananse().configure({
  session: { type: "redis" }, // Database to store session data. Eg. mysql, postgres and redis
  ...
});

export default ananse;
```

Below is a list of supported session storage backends:

- `memory` - In-memory session storage
- `redis` - Redis session storage
- `mysql` - MySQL session storage
- `postgres` - Postgres session storage

Refer to [session storage](/docs/session-storage) guide on how to create a custom session storage.

{/* TODO: Writeup on how to create custom session storage */}

## USSD Gateway

Ananse can be configured to support any USSD gateway. The USSD gateway to use can be configured using the `gateway` option in the `configure` method.

```typescript
const ananse = new Ananse().configure({
  gateway: "hubtel", // USSD gateway to use, eg. hubtel, africas_talking.
  ...
});
```

Below is a list of supported USSD gateways:

| Gateway                                                      | Key         | Supported           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| [Wigal USSD v1](https://frog.wigal.com.gh/developers/docs/ussd)   | `wigal`     | :white_check_mark:  |
| [Wigal USSD v2](https://frog.wigal.com.gh/developers/docs/ussd)   |      | :x:  |
| Emergent Technology USSD              |  `emergent_technology`        | :white_check_mark:  |
| [AfricasTalking USSD](https://africastalking.com)             |         | :x:  |

Is your USSD gateway not supported? Feel free to open an issue or create a pull request to add support for it.

## Middlewares

Ananse supports middleware, which are custom classes, that can access the request and response object in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The [USSD gateways](#ussd-gateway) are implemented as middleware classes. Middleware can perform the following tasks:

- Execute any code.
- Make changes to the request and the response objects.
- End the request-response cycle.

Middleware can be added to the application using the `middlewares` option in the `configure` method.

```typescript
const ananse = new Ananse().configure({
  middlewares: [MyCustomGateway, MyOtherMiddleware],
  ...
});
```

:::danger

The order in which middleware are added is important. Middleware are executed in the order they are added.

:::

## Pagination

Pagination is enabled by default, it is triggered if the menu content exceeds the **182* character limit. Set the `enabled` option to `false` to disable pagination. The navigation options can be configured using the `pagination` option in the `configure` method.

```typescript
const ananse = new Ananse().configure({
  pagination: {
    enabled: true,
    nextPage: {
      display: "*. More",
      choice: "*",
    },
    previousPage: {
      display: "#. Back",
      choice: "#",
    },
  },
  ...
});
```
